\f0\fs24 \cf0 Here are some of the most basic commands you.\
\
pwd\
Find out the location/name of the folder currently opened in your terminal window.\
\
ls\
List the files and folders of the location currently opened in terminal. Many times used as ls -lah which shows hidden files as well as it converts file-sizes to a human-readable form.\
\
cd\
Change directory. Allows you to move in your disk from one location to another.\
\
mkdir\
Creates a new folder under the currently opened location. Note that you can create only a single new folder. If you want to create a hierarchy of folders you can use the -p parameter. For example:\
mkdir new-folder\
mkdir -p path1/path2/new-folder\
\
cp\
Copies a file from one location to another. If you want to copy a folder, use the \'91-R\'92 flag. For example:\
cp .bashrc bashrc.backup\
cp -R Movies Movies.backup\
\
rm and rmdir\
Delete a file or a folder. OK, here you can actually make your Mac explode if you\'92re not careful, so always double-check that you have correctly specified the arguments to the rm command.\
\
cat, more, less\
Lets you view the content of a text file. For example:\
cat .bashrc\
more .bashrc\
less .bashrc\
\
grep \
Filters a text file on the keyword you specify. For example, if you have a large text file in which you want to see if your name is mentioned, you can execute the following command:\
cat mylargefile.txt | grep john\
If your name is not john\'85 well, you know what I mean. Just use any keyword you wish here.\
\
du\
Shows you the Disk Usage, a useful command to find out how much space is occupied by a folder. It is usually used with the -hs flag to only show totals in human-readable form. For example:\
du -hs Movies\
\
\
man\
Displays the manual page of any supported command. This little built-in utility shows you all available information about a specific command including all the arguments and flags you can use. For example:\
man ls\
